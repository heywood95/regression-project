# Regression-Project
 
# Project Description
 
The property values for Zillow will be investigated using a variety of target variables to predict what affects property value using regression techniques, and make predictions on property values. I have decided to look into four different areas that may affect property value.
 
# Project Goal
 
* Construct an ML Regression model that predicts propery tax assessed values of Single Family Properties using features of the properties.
* Find the key drivers of property value for single family properties. 
* Deliver a report that explains what steps were taken, why and what the outcome was.
* Make recommendations on what works or doesn't work in predicting these homes' values.

 
# Initial Thoughts
 
My initial hypothesis is that the property value will increase with square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
 
# The Plan
 
* Aquire data from zillow database
 
* Prepare data
   * Cleaned up data
       * Dropped unnecessary columns  
       * Renamed confusing columns  
       * Dropped duplicate columns  
       * Replaced null values in the hottub_spa, pools, garages, and stories columns  
       * Eliminated outliers in the square_footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, and property_value columns   
       * Dropped null values  
       * split the data  
 
* Explore data in search of drivers of property value
   * Answer the following initial questions
       * Does the square footage of a property increase, decrease, or is irrelevant in 
         determining the property value.
       * What number of bedrooms is optimal for the property value of a house?
       * Does the number of bathrooms increase the property value?
       * Is there an optimal square footage for property value?
      
* Develop a Model to predict the property value of a house
   * Use drivers identified in explore to build predictive models of different types
   * Evaluate models on train and validate data
   * Select the best model based on highest validate and difference accuracy
   * Evaluate the best model on test data
 
* Draw conclusions

# Steps to Reproduce
1) Clone this repo.
2) Acquire the data from Codeup DB Server/zillow
3) Put the data in the file containing the cloned repo.
4) Run notebook.
 
# Takeaways and Conclusions
* Bathrooms, bedrooms, and square footage are the top three features with the strongest correlation.
    * Square footage has the strongest correlation of all the features.
* There is a moderate corellation between square footage and property value. 
    * Further investigation into size of the property and its value is necessary in determing the optimal square footage.
* There is a slight correlation between the number of bedrooms and property value. It is difficult to determine the maximum number of bedrooms based on the chart.
* The optimal number of bathrooms to optimize property value appears to be 3.5. However more investigation is required to confirm this finding. Further analysis on optimizing the cost of building a property, location, and comparing that the total value of the propery is neccessary.
* The optimal square footage is between 1001-2000 square feet. However, there is a moderate negative correlation and the large number of homes within this range could be causing this correlation.
 
# Recommendations
* The square footage of a house appears to be optimal between 1000-2000 square feet.
* The number of bedrooms does not apeear to be a significant factor in determining the property value. However, targeted analysis on specific bedroom counts could produce different conclusions.
* The number of optimal bathrooms appears to be 3.5, although more analysis into the increase in value is necessarry to confirm this conclusion.
