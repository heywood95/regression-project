# Regression-Project
 
# Project Description
 
The property values for Zillow will be investigated using a variety of target variables to predict what affects property value using regression techniques, and make predictions on property values. I have decided to look into four different areas that may affect property value.
 
# Project Goal
 
* Find drivers for customer churn at Telco. Why are customers churning?
* Construct a ML classification model that accurately predicts customer churn.
* Deliver a report that a non-data scientist can read through and understand what steps were taken, why and what was the outcome?

 
# Initial Thoughts
 
My initial hypothesis is that drivers of churn will depend on the type of service used by a customer and the amount of the montly payments.
 
# The Plan
 
* Aquire data from telco_churn database
 
* Prepare data
   * Cleaned up data
       * Dropped unnecessary columns  
       * Renamed confusing columns  
       * Dropped duplicate columns  
       * Replaced null values in the hottub_spa, pools, garages, and stories columns  
       * Eliminated outliers in the square_footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, and property_value columns   
       * Dropped null values  
       * split the data  
 
* Explore data in search of drivers of upsets
   * Answer the following initial questions
       * Does the square footage of a property increase, decrease, or is irrelevant in 
         determining the property value.
       * What number of bedrooms is optimal for the property value of a house
       * Does the number of bathrooms increase the property value?
       * Does the zipcode effect the lot size and is this a determining factor in the 
         property value.
      
* Develop a Model to predict the property value of a house
   * Use drivers identified in explore to build predictive models of different types
   * Evaluate models on train and validate data
   * Select the best model based on highest validate and difference accuracy
   * Evaluate the best model on test data
 
* Draw conclusions

2) Acquire the data from Codeup DB Server/zillow
3) Put the data in the file containing the cloned repo.
4) Run notebook.
 
# Takeaways and Conclusions
* About 43% of customers with fiber optic churned.
* About 13% of customers without fiber optic churned.
* It is more likely that customers who have fiber optic churned versus customers who did not have fiber optic.
* Month to month contracts have the highest level of churn.
* One year contracts are the next highest, but still relatively low churn.
* Two year contracts have the lowest level of churn.
* While it is no surprise that month to month contracts produce the highest level of churn, the drastic drop from month to month to one       year and two year contracts should be looked at and possible incentives or discounts for the one year and two year contracts could reduce   the amount of month to month contracts and level of churn.
* Customers with online security have 17% churn rate.
* Customers with no internet service have an 11% churn rate.
* Customers withouth online security have a 40% churn rate.
* The major contributor for customer churn is more correlated with internet services that provide security such as tech support, device       protection, online backup, and online security.
* Other services for entertainment purposes such as streaming tv and movies had less of an impact on customer churn.
* As charges increase, churn increases until the rate reaches over 100 dollars.
* The largest proportion of customers spent between 20-30 dollars.
* It would appear that the more money that was spent by the customer, the more likely they are to churn.
* The large majority of those that churned spent 500 dollars or less on total charges.
* Those customers who spent about 80 dollars a month were the most likely to churn.
* Total charges produced insufficient data to support a correlation between total charges and churn.
 
# Recommendations
* To reduce churn decrease the amount of month to month contracts and increase the amount of one and two year contracts.
* Provide online security to all of the customers, this area produced the highest probability of customer churn.
